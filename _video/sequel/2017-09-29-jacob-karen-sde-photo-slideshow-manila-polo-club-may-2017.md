Jacob and Karen booked our Photo Video team without question.

We learned later on that Karen has long been a fan of Threelogy's work and have made a decision long before her engagement that she will get us for her wedding.

She got excited when she found out during her wedding preparation that we are already offering photo video services to clients. She immediately booked us without even asking for our photo collection.

To show our appreciation, we surprised her with this SDE Photo slideshow which was played at her wedding day reception.

They loved it and we love them!

To Jacob and Karen, thank you for trusting us to cover your big day, we feel so blessed to have been a part of it! Stay happy and in love! :*
