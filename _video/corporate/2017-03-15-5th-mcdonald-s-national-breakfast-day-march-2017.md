This is McDonaldâ€™s 5th National Breakfast Day and we are happy to say that this is also the 5th time they got us to shoot the event.

Itâ€™s always been nice to see excited, happy faces looking forward to getting their free McDonaldâ€™s sandwiches for breakfast. Who wouldnâ€™t be? Everybody loves McDonaldâ€™s and I for one am addicted to their Cheesy EggDesal with Ham! Delish! Indeed, itâ€™s the #BestMondayEver! Until next time!

For bookings, send us an email at: inquiry@threelogyvideo.com

Thank you for watching! ðŸ™‚
