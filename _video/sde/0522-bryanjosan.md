Sharing with you all the happy, emotional and at the same time funny wedding highlights of one of our beautiful multiracial couple Josan who is Filipino-Spanish & Bryan, Filipino-Chinese.

Bryan “found” Josan in Facebook. :)

Both geeky, both funny & both love to travel.

Similar interests drew them together, they became friends, fell in love & not long after, decided to get married. In this day & age, we really wouldn’t know where love will find us.

To Josan & Bryan, Congratulations!!! Here’s to more years of Facebooking & loving one another deeply! :)
