Club Balai Isabel

A small wedding. Family. Closest friends. No media.

That’s how Oyo and Tin wanted their wedding and that’s exactly what they got. The result – one of the sweetest, loveliest and funniest wedding we’ve ever seen, heard and covered. To say they’re happy together is an understatement (just watch the SDE and see what I mean).

Oyo made one request the day before the wedding, that we use Howie Day’s Collide on their SDE. The exact same song used in Tin’s march.

Tin, on the other hand, wanted the SDE soundbites and vows-free. A bummer for those who weren’t there, the two did exchange some sweet and funny words that day. But like I said, they got exactly what they wanted. :)
