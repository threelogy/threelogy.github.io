One of the cutest, most fun couples we’ve ever had!

The bride is so funny, spontaneous & sweet. Go watch & check out her bouquet made of paper. I love that their wedding is so nontraditional that they didn’t even have a program & just danced the night away! It was so fun to see them all enjoy the party. :)

The groom on the other hand is just as sweet & loving to his bride. He looks like a Korean pop star & I super love his hair!

Together, they make one lovely couple. Do watch & start your weekend with a smile. ;)
