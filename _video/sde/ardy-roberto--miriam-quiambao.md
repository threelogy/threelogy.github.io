Ville Sommet

Anthony Pangilinan, who hosted the newlywed’s wedding reception program with his stunning wife Maricel Laxa, actually paved the way for Miriam to meet Ardy. But it wasn’t to pair them up. Ardy was still reeling after his wife lost her battle with lupus. While Miriam, on the other hand, was still recovering from a failed marriage and Anthony was helping her get back on her feet with the help of God. Ardy became Miriam’s mentor at a workshop then God, as everyone simply described it, worked his magic.

And that magic was very evident when Ardy and Miriam finally tied the knot last Tuesday. Their actions and most especially their vows showed their overwhelming love for each other. We, along with everyone else that day, believe that they have indeed found the right person to spend the rest of their lives with. And I’m pretty sure that you’ll say the exact same thing after you watch the beginning of their latest #AMventure.

To Ardy and Miriam, Cheers!!! :)
