A few things we love about Indian weddings:

<p>1. Intricate wedding ceremonies. We’ve shot all kinds of weddings and nothing comes close. Nothing.</p>
<p>2. All the dancing. They must’ve invented the phrase “Dance ’til you drop!”.</p>
<p>3. Non-stop eating. I’d say possibly a direct result of number 2 in this list.</p>
<p>4. Love is everywhere. One can easily get confused and forget the actual reason why they’re there with all the ceremonies, food and dancing. But nope, you will feel that love is in the air every … single … moment.</p>
<p>5. And lastly, it’s a four day celebration! Four days! How fun is that?!</p>

So here’s Jatinder and Hardeep’s wedding. Enjoy! :)
