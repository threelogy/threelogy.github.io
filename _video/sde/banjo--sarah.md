Alright, knowing that these guys head Steak Productions, we kinda expected their wedding to be a bit different than usual. And guess what, we didn’t go home disappointed.

Sarah wore a Rajo Laurel gown. In awesome purple.

The gents came in sneakers. And us too. :)

VJs KC Montero and Cindy Kurleto hosted the reception. Can’t get cooler than that.

Their DJ kept the floor full to the brim … groovin’.

And their SDE song, a motown-hit by Stevie Wonder, quite honestly the most difficult song we ever used in an SDE. But based on everyone’s reaction, I think we pulled it off. 😉

Here’s Banjo and Sarah’s wedding – signed, sealed, delivered!
