Alright, knowing that these guys head Steak Productions, we kinda expected their wedding to be a bit different than usual. And guess what, we didnâ€™t go home disappointed.

Sarah wore a Rajo Laurel gown. In awesome purple.

The gents came in sneakers. And us too. :)

VJs KC Montero and Cindy Kurleto hosted the reception. Canâ€™t get cooler than that.

Their DJ kept the floor full to the brim â€¦ groovinâ€™.

And their SDE song, a motown-hit by Stevie Wonder, quite honestly the most difficult song we ever used in an SDE. But based on everyoneâ€™s reaction, I think we pulled it off. ðŸ˜‰

Hereâ€™s Banjo and Sarahâ€™s wedding â€“ signed, sealed, delivered!

Thank you for watching! :)
