Oliver and Jenica got married at the Tagaytay Highlands helipad, apparently the first time a wedding ceremony was ever held there. It rained. A couple of times, in fact. But hundreds of umbrellas were handed out and everyone stood their our ground. No one flinched. Not us wedding suppliers, not one of the guests and most specially not Oliver and Jenica. No rain is gonna stop these two from having their dream wedding.

They have been going on endless adventures since the day they met and it’s only fitting that their own wedding ended up being one as well. And you know what, I’m pretty sure they’ll be making more and more adventures in the years to come.

To Oliver and Jenica, best wishes and may the adventures keep coming. Cheers! :)
