January 17 is one day all of us at Threelogy will always remember. Why? Because on this day, we covered, not one, but two celebrity weddings. So please forgive me for posting two videos in one day (when posting one in a week depended on luck) and on time (average leadtime for me to upload a vid: two weeks). So, I’m calling it the January 17 specials. :)

Aside from the fact that the couple picked Jim Brickman’s “The Simple Things” for this vid, I really can’t say much about Jojo and Ciara’s wedding since theirs was covered by CJ and Jon’s team, but watching this SDE (and after all the stories I heard from CJ), I’m pretty damn sure that the couple, their relatives and friends are truly happy (about the wedding and this vid).

For bookings, send us an email at: inquiry@threelogyvideo.com

Thank you for watching!
