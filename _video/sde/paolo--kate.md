Madre De Dios

Midlands Veranda

A beautiful, charming and sweet bride + a handsome and cool groom + friends and relatives + a small blackboard, a box of chalk and an eraser + the Red Hot Chili Peppers = one of the coolest SDEs we have ever done. Well, anything with Anthony Kiedis and Flea â€“ I find cool.

Congratulations Paolo and Kate, and see you in Vietnam soon!

Cheers! :)
