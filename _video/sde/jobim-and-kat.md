“Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.” – Bruce Lee

Funny how true this is. But yeah, Bruce Lee couldn’t be more right. And that flame, you’ll never know how it’ll start. It can start catching fire at a coffee shop, in school, a club or the emergency room of the The Medical City. You won’t know! :)
