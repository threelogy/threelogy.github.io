One thing we learned about this couple is that they don’t like videos. In fact, they don’t like videos so much that they only asked us to make a Save-the-Date, an Engagement and an SDE for their wedding day. Just three. Told you don’t like videos. 😉

The dress-up, the emotional Christian ceremony and the joyous reception program all took place at the Green Canyon, a spanking new eco resort is Clark Field, Pampanga.

Working with these two is an absolute breeze. They know what they want but they definitely know how to have fun while at it. They gave us absolute freedom in these three videos and we’re mighty glad they loved all of it.

So, to our beautiful bride Paula and equally handsome balladeer Emman, Congratulations and Best Wishes. Cheers!!! :)
