Such a wonderful way to announce a pregnancy to family and friends, this baby, growing in mom’s tummy is well loved!

Years from now, I’m sure he or she will be more than happy to look back on this video, Dad Mart and Mom Lauren had made. Such loving soon to be parents!

We feel so blessed to have been a part of this beautiful gift to the baby!

Thanks Mart and Lauren! We wish you well! Enjoy your pregnancy! :)
