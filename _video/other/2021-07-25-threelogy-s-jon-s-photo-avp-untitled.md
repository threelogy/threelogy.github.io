Dear everyone, it is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of our dear friend, one of Threelogy‚Äôs business partners, Jon, last May 23, 2021 due to heart attack.üíî

We still couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs gone. He was just 46 years old. He was so strong and didn‚Äôt have any illness he was aware of. 

His mobile phone shows he researched about heartburn on the day he died, sadly, he had no idea that he was already having a heart attack. 

The moment he complained of chest pain, he was gone in like 2 minutes. It was that fast. He didn‚Äôt show he was in pain at all. He may have had a really high tolerance for pain or he may not want his wife to worry who was with him when it sadly happened. 

We urge you all to see a doctor if anyone of you experiences heartburn as it could be a heart attack. The symptoms are similar and even experienced doctors couldn‚Äôt tell the difference that‚Äôs why tests are necessary. 

Below is the photo AVP we did for him which was presented at his Celebration of Life Virtual Event held days after he passed away. 

Jon was so well loved and most info. about his death are made public by his wife, Maria, for all his friends and family to have access to read and share. 

We truly miss him and will forever be grateful for all that he had done for Threelogy. We wouldn‚Äôt last this long, 17 years now and counting if it were not for his contribution. 

We also would like to apologize to those who have sent us messages and emails, those inquiring about our services and rates, we are so sorry for the delay and for not being able to reply yet to so many of you.

Rest assured that Threelogy is still on, we know that Jon would want for us to continue even without him physically with us and this is what we want to do, this is our passion and have been doing this for many years now and it‚Äôs all but natural for us to carry on in spite of losing him. 

We will be replying to each and everyone of you in the coming days/weeks. Please bear with us.

Take care everyone and do include Jon, his family and us in your prayers to help us get through this very difficult time. 

Thanks much for your continued support. ‚ù§
