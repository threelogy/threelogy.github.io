Excerpt from Anne‚Äôs letter to Erick:

Thank you for loving me and accepting me for everything that I am. Thank you for loving Savannah as your own. Just when I thought I couldn‚Äôt love you anymore than I already do, each and every day that I witness how you look out for her, care for her, love her, I keep falling for you over and over again.

Truly heart touching. üò¢‚ù§Ô∏è
