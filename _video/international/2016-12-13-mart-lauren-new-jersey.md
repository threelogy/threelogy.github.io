A lot of things happened prior to Mart & Lauren’s big day to the point where you feel like you are in a teleserye (tv series) and what’s currently going on is not real.

In the end, everything went as planned and the couple & all their friends & family couldn’t be happier. After all, love always wins.

This is the coldest place we have been to for work, just -2 degrees ;) …but the couple’s love for each other & everyone around is enough to keep us all warm & fuzzy.

To Mart & Lauren, thank you for choosing us to be a part of your love story! We feel so blessed to have covered your special day! Best wishes! <3
