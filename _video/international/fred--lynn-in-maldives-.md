Our couple from China, Fred & Lynn want to celebrate their upcoming wedding in one of the world’s most romantic place, Maldives.

Before getting married in front of their friends & family, they first decided to take a break & just enjoy each other's company in this stunning white sand beach.

Here they declare their love for one another, in a tuxedo & a wedding gown & got us to film this part of their love story. They then had it played later on to show to their guests at their wedding in China.

How beautiful it turned out to be! Now, they have something that will always remind them of how lovely their relationship is! ♥♥♥

To Fred & Lyn, thank you for the trust. Here’s wishing you a lifetime of marital bliss!!! :)
