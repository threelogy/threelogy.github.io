  header: When did you start?
  description: "Threelogy Video was founded 14 years ago by 3 college buddies. \n<br/>\n\nIn
    college, when out of town with their friends, they usually have a handycam ready
    to capture everything that is happening candidly for fun and edits the footage
    at the end of the trip. They will then watch it all together to relieve the moment.
    \n<br/>\nYears after that, in April of 2004, they shot their first paid event
    and not long after, celebrities and high profile clients started booking them
    to cover their own special events. They became known thru word of mouth and the
    rest as they say is history. \n<br/>\nThreelogy’s expertise lies in capturing
    the event as it naturally happens, showcasing the unique personalities of each
    couple without making them act out of their way to create an amazing video. They
    have always been on the natural, candid and real side of covering an event."

  header: Do you shoot weddings outside of the Philippines?
  description: As a matter of fact we do, we just don’t like putting the words “international”
    and “worldwide” before or after our name. Because if we’re being honest, we think
    that’s just a lot of marketing bull****. You can check some of our “international”
    shoots in the Videos page.

  description: Nah, no one actually asks this question, but we’ve covered one already
    and we won’t mind doing it again. Love always wins, after all.
